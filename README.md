# Jmix Core

Jmix is a high-level full-stack framework for enterprise web applications. See the [website](https://jmix.io) and the [documentation](https://docs.jmix.io) for more information.

This repository contains the core project of the framework. Other parts of the framework are located in [separate repositories](https://github.com/Haulmont?q=jmix).

The recommended way of working with Jmix codebase is to use [jmix-all](https://github.com/Haulmont/jmix-all) aggregator project. See its README for instructions.
